    <template #content>
      <p>CollegeFootballData.com (CFBD) is a sports statistics and analytics website with no
        direct affiliation to the NCAA, its member conferences, or its member teams.</p>
      <p>All data is unofficial and subject to change at any time. No guarantees are made regarding
        the accuracy of any data.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or notice any issues you can reach me via Twitter (<b-link

      <div class="text-lg font-bold text-center">Data Updates</div>
      <p>Update frequency depends on the type of data. Generally, game level data is updated within
        minutes
        of a game being completed. This includes box score data, scores, drive data, and play data. Betting line
        data is updated every 15 minutes. Poll data usually goes live on the same day a new poll is released.
        Rosters, team talent, and returning production usually go live in August right before the start of a new season.
        Recruiting data is currently updated a few times a cycle. Draft data goes live right after completion of the NFL
        Draft.

      <div class="text-lg font-bold text-center">Cost and Usage</div>
      <p>This website and its companion API are completely free to use without restrictions.
        Attribution
        is always greatly appreciated. Some functionality may be available exclusively to Patreon subscribers. Patreon
        subscribers also are able to use the API with less frequent request throttling.</p>
      <p>Please utilize good API usage habits when interacting with the API. This includes making
        efficient use of calls to grab greater chunks of data at a time as opposed to more frequent calls of smaller data
        chunks (i.e. "chunky" vs "chatty" calls). Abusing the free and public nature of the API may result in your key
        becoming blacklisted.</p>

      <div class="text-lg font-bold text-center">Data Corrections and New Data</div>
      <p>If you have data corrections or even some new data you would like to submit for inclusion,
        please reach out to me at any of the methods mentioned at the top of the page. CSV files works best. To ensure
        speediest inclusion of your submission, please be sure to include any relevant id fields (e.g. game id, play id,
        athlete id, etc). This is a one-person operation and I try to get things included as quickly as I am able. Your
        patience is very much appreciated.</p>
